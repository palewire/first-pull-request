# Forks

A fork is a copy of a repository that belongs to someone else. When you fork a repository, you create a personal copy of the original.

You can then make changes to your fork without affecting the original repository. This is useful if you want to make changes to a project when you don't have permission to edit the original.

You are now looking at your fork of the original cummings.ee repository. The only difference is the commit you just made, adding a new poem to the YAML directory for “is 5.”

The next step is to propose that your edits be included in the source repository, a process that GitHub calls a pull request.
