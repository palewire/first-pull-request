# Forks

A fork is a copy of a repository that belongs to someone else. When you fork a repository, you create a personal copy of the original that belongs to you.

You can change your fork without affecting the original. This is useful if you want to suggest changes to a project when you don't have permission to edit the source.

You are now looking at your fork of the original cummings.ee repository. The only difference is the commit you just made, adding a new poem to the YAML directory for “is 5.”

The next step is to propose that your edits be included in the source repository, a process that GitHub calls a pull request.
