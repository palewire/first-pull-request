# What you will do

If you complete this class, you will gain a basic understanding of how to submit an open-source software patch on [github.com](https://github.com), the leading code-management site. 

You will fork a code repository, make edits to the source and then propose your changes be included in the original project. This pattern, known as a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests), is fundamental to the process that allows developers around the world to collaborate.

As part of the practice, students will make real contributions to [cummings.ee](https://cummings.ee), the in-progress, crowdsourced effort to transcribe the poetry of [Edward Estlin Cummings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._E._Cummings).
